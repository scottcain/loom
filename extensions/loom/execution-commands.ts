 * Before sending the agent off, run a precondition check (see init-gate.ts):
 * - hard failures (no notebook; plan needs Galaxy but disconnected) refuse
 *   to send the agent prompt at all
 * - soft failures (no plan; weak acceptance criteria; no history selected
 *   for a Galaxy plan) still prompt, but the prompt carries the failure
 *   list so the agent resolves with the user before invoking anything
